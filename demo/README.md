## Environment
In the [.env](.env) file you can choose a robot and a dds configuration you want to work with.

## Run with `docker compose`
To start simulation build and run webots simulator container type:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.rosbot.webots.yaml up
```
It will take a while because the container has to download required assets.

Wait until this messages show up in the Webots console.
> INFO: 'rosbot' extern controller: connected.
>
> INFO: 'Ros2Supervisor' extern controller: connected.

Then run rviz2 to navigate the ROSBot:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.rviz.yaml up
```
Now you can use `teleop_twist` tool to drive ROSbot with keyboard.
Enter `rviz` container:
```bash
docker exec -it rviz bash
```

Now, to teleoperate the ROSbot with your keyboard, execute:
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
